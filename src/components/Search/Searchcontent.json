        "description": "Applied AI: When AI solves real world problems Artificial Intelligence is a promising technological marvel that holds the key to the future. AI encompasses the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing in a human-like manner. However, the true value of AI is realised when it is applied to real-world scenarios and used to address actual challenges. This is what Applied AI refers to. The importance of Applied AI in the current context is immense. A Gartner survey revealed that the number of enterprises adopting AI increased by 270% in the last four years - and remarkably, it tripled in the last year alone! Benefits of Applied AI AI holds a promising future for economies of G20 countries.

It is a crucial skill for many domains, such as business, economics, weather, sports, and health. Forecasting is the process of using historical data, trends, and statistics to predict future outcomes or events. Forecasting has immense applications: from predicting weather patterns and the movement of stocks, to evaluating economies of countries, scientific research, and so on.However, forecasting can also be challenging, complex, and uncertain, especially if you are dealing with large and dynamic data sets. That's where the power of artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.",

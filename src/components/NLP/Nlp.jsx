                      Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary
                      field that combines linguistics, computer science, and
                      artificial intelligence. It aims to enable computers to
                      understand and communicate with humans using natural
                      language. NLP involves developing algorithms and systems
                      that can process and analyse large volumes of language
                      data, and use it to interact with humans.

                    <p className="mb-5">
                      Interestingly, NLP began in the 1940s after World War II
                      when people recognized the importance of translating
                      languages using a machine. They wanted a machine that
                      could do this automatically, and thus aid in communicating
                      effectively without physical and language barriers. The
                      1960s saw some early forms of NLP, which included SHRDLU -
                      a natural language system that worked with restricted
                      vocabularies.

                    <p className="mb-5">
                      Then, after nearly 60 years, innovations under NLP saw its
                      biggest boost yet – thanks to Transformers.

                      In 2017, Google released its famous "Attention is All You
                      Need" research paper, which introduced a new network
                      architecture called the Transformer. The Transformer was a
                      breakthrough in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because
                      it relied only on attention mechanisms. This enabled the
                      model to pay attention to different parts of the input
                      sequence when generating an output.

                    <p className="mb-5">
                      Moreover, Transformers did not use recurrence or
                      convolutions – which are two different types of neural
                      networks used in deep learning. This allowed these
                      Transformer models to be superior in quality, as well as
                      fast to train.

                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses a variety of
                    techniques and methods to process and analyse human
                    language. However, the whole process of building an NLP
                    model can be classified as the culmination of three
                    processes - computational linguistics, deep learning, and
                    (lots of) statistics.

                  <p>
                    Computational linguistics refers to combining natural
                    language and computational approaches to linguistic
                    questions. Deep learning is a subfield of artificial
                    intelligence that uses neural networks to learn from large
                    amounts of data and make predictions based on these data.
                    Statistics is also used in NLP to refine the training data,
                    develop algorithms, and build models on top of these
                    training data and algorithms.

                    Over recent years, the field of NLP has seen a wide range of
                    applications. Some prominent applications of NLP used by

                    On the technical front, there are three steps taken to train
                    an NLP: data acquisition, data training, and data
                    fine-tuning. The model takes a text input (raw data) and
                    splits it into smaller units that the machine can
                    understand. The model then extracts useful information from
                    these units and applies machine learning algorithms to
                    process it. The machine repeats this process with some
                    adjustments to improve the output, and the machine learns
                    progressively.

                    language model is confident in its output, which can deceive
                    or misinform people on a large scale.

                    Thus, improper implementation of NLP applications in your

                    erroneously. This apparent risk only increases in magnitude

                    The good news is, there are many ways through which you can
                    overcome these shortcomings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, you can improve the quality and diversity of your
                    training data. This will help your model avoid hallucination
                    and misinformation, as it will have more and varied data to
                    learn from.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, identifying and reducing the inherent biases in
                    the data also makes these models less susceptible towards
                    generating erroneous responses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, you can use better regularisation methods.
                    Regularisation methods are methods that help prevent
                    overfitting and other issues in the AI model that could lead
                    to hallucinations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, employing adversarial training and
                    reinforcement learning also improves the robustness of NLP
                    models and reduces the risk of hallucinations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Third, you can apply more constraints on the model's output,
                    such as limiting the length of responses or limiting the
                    scope of facts. This will help your model generate more
                    relevant and accurate responses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we can see, AI can offer many benefits for your
                    organisation. However, the correct implementation of AI in
                    your organisation is important.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may seem easy to use AI-based solutions for various
                    tasks, but the reality is that NLP apps, like any other deep
                    learning applications, are not always reliable. The reason
                    for this is that the more data and complexity you have, the
                    more unpredictable the deep learning architecture becomes.

                    Right now, NLP is one of the most important and influential
                    fields in the age of AI. However, NLP also faces many
                    limitations and challenges that need to be addressed.{' '}

                  <p>
                    To make the best use of NLP, one needs to understand how the
                    NLP model works and design the optimal way to implement it
                    in the organisation.{' '}

                    AI is not truly intelligent, but rather imitates human
                    intelligence. This is because AI learns from a specific data
                    set, and its knowledge is bounded by the data that it is
                    exposed to during its training. They do not possess any
                    intelligence of their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, AI does not have reasoning abilities; it cannot
                    distinguish between right and wrong, true and false, or
                    biased and unbiased facts. For a machine, all information –
                    regardless of its quality – is simply ‘data’ from the
                    viewpoint of AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This leads to another problem of AI – it can make biassed
                    conclusions. This depends largely on the quality of the data
                    that is used to train the AI system. If the data is skewed
                    or incomplete, or if the algorithm that runs the AI system
                    has some errors, it could lead to unwanted outcomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These 'undesirable' outputs can have serious implications
                    for enterprises that rely on large-scale data. For example,
                    CNET, a well-known news outlet, experimented with AI to
                    produce web articles for its website. However, to their
                    disappointment, the news-outlet found errors in more than

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This undesirable outcome is the result of bad AI deployment
                    and insufficient consideration towards the risks associated
                    with AI
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, it is essential for organisations to exercise
                    caution when integrating AI into one's organisation or
                    workflow.
